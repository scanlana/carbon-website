Names are more logical\n  and easier to apply without always having to refer to a guide.\n\n- Nothing visually has changed in any of the components, and so no redesign work\n  is required.\n\n### What are the benefits of Carbon v11 for me as a developer?\n\n- CSS grid provides easier implementation of layouts, support for sub-grid, and\n  other features that come along with this new technology.\n\n- CSS custom properties for theming (light mode / dark mode).\n\n- A significant reduction in compile times for most projects with the update to\n  Sass architecture.\n\n- Quality of life updates such as:\n\n  - Consistent component API across the board.\n  - Improvements to Sass structure for getting started and productive use\n    experiences.\n\n- New components:\n  - Cover a wider variety of use-cases in your product with some of our new\n    components.\n  - Easily build our more accessible experiences with our accessibility\n    component primitives.\n\n### What are the benefits to my product’s customers?\n\n- Light/dark mode support.\n- Faster time to develop new features.\n- New components added that can be used instead of being newly developed.\n- Accessibility primitives to help build more accessible experiences as early as\n  possible to the development process.\n- Faster load times due to smaller bundle sizes.\n- Faster time to develop new features\n- New components added that can be used to build off of instead of being newly\n  developed\n- Accessibility primitives to help build more accessible experiences as early as\n  possible in the development process\n\n### Do I need to update right away? If not, when will we need to update?\n\n- Carbon v11 includes functionality that may be a motivator for migration, but\n  teams can migrate to v11 when they have the bandwidth.\n\n- Teams that are using v10 today can continue to stay on v10 and everything that\n  is implemented will continue to work.\n\n### What will the Carbon team be supporting for v10?\n\n- No new functionality will be introduced in v10 after the v11 release.\n\n- We will continue to address high impact bugs that come up for the v10 release\n  after the v11 release.\n\n- We will continue to accept any contributions that look to address issues in\n  the v10 release if we are unable to get to them in time for your product\n  roadmap.\n\n### What is the rule for supporting deprecated assets?\n\n- Assets that were deprecated from v9 to v10 will be removed in v11.\n\n- Assets that are deprecated in v10 will remain in v11 and will be removed in\n  v12. While the timeline of v12 has not been set, the team’s intent is for\n  major versions to be at minimum 12 months apart.\n\n### Will I need to redesign my product?\n\n- Visually, nothing is changing.\n\n- There are system-side changes that will require changes to design specs and\n  code, like the token names update and inline theming.\n\n- Token names are largely a 1:1 update and very few tokens are keeping their v10\n  name. This means color tokens will have to be updated across assets.\n\n- We are hoping to be able to provide a script that can make these changes on\n  the code side automatically, however this has not been built or tested yet.\n\n### Why rename things instead of leaving things as they are?\n\n- Making these updates now creates a better system user experience and it sets\n  us up for growth and scale so new tokens can fit into the set more easily.\n\n- The new names imply the usage and so will be much easier to apply. For\n  example, `text-03` will be `text-placeholder`.\n\n### How big is the effort to migrate from the v10 to v11 Figma kit?\n\nThe v10 Carbon libraries are separate from the new v11 Carbon libraries. We\ncreated separate Figma libraries for v10 and v11 based on user feedback for\nversioning purposes. The v10 libraries will not have a continuous update to\nmigrate to v11. Migration to the new v11 Carbon libraries will be a manual\nprocess. For additional migration steps, head [here](/design#kit-migration).\n\n### How big is the expected effort to migrate code to v11?\n\n_We'll have more on this once we have interviewed teams that have successfully\nmigrated to v11._\n\n## Sass and package management\n\n### What packages should I be installing?\n\nIf you're using our React components, `@carbon/react` will have everything you\nneed to use along with it: component styles, icons, grid, theming and type. This\npackage essentially includes all our most used code assets in Carbon. If you've\ninstalled this package, you should not have to install our styles, grid, theme,\nicons or type packages.\n\nIn order to use our styles with this package, all you need to include is the\nfollowing in your `index.scss`:\n\n```scss\n@use '@carbon/react';\n```\n\nWe understand that this can be a bit bulky, and sometimes you don't want all of\nthe styles that come with that. To include styles for something more specific,\nwe suggest including them like so:\n\n```scss\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/components/[componentname]';\n```\n\n### What if I want to use a specific theme?\n\nIn v11 we introduced a component called `<GlobalTheme/>`. This component makes\nit really easy to change the default theme by using it as a wrapper in your app,\nand passing in a `theme` prop value of `white`, `g10`, `g90`, or `g100`.\n\n### What if I want to do zoned theming or toggle themes?\n\nWe recommend using our `<Theme/>` component to include zoned themes. A great\nexample of zoned theming using this component lives in our\n[tutorial](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial/blob/v11-react-step-5/src/App.js),\nwhere we themed the header differently than the application theme. If you are\nwanting to toggle themes, for a light and dark mode, we built an\n[example](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/main/examples/light-dark-mode)\nfor you using our `GlobalTheme` component.\n\n### What if I want to use a custom theme?\n\nIf you are creating a custom theme or overriding theme tokens, you would do that\nlike so:\n\n```scss\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/themes' as *;\n\n//overriding theme tokens and adding a custom token\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/theme' with (\n  $theme: (\n    // add a completely new token\n    custom-token: #bada44,\n    // redefine existing tokens to new values\n    text-error: rebeccapurple,\n    focus: pink,\n  )\n);\n\n// override a component token\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/components/button/tokens' as button-tokens with (\n  $button-primary: #3f51b5\n);\n@use '@carbon/react';\n\n:root {\n  @include theme.theme();\n}\n\n// You can access a custom variable via the theme.get() mixin\n.custom-token {\n  background: rgba(theme.get('custom-token'), 0.95);\n}\n```\n\nCheck out the full example we built\n[here](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/main/examples/custom-theme).\n\n### I'm not familiar with sass. How do I learn more?\n\nHey, we get it. Sass can be a little different if you've never worked with it,\nespecially sass modules. We recommend reading through some of the Sass\ndocumentation to learn more. A great place to start is\n[Sass Basics](https://sass-lang.com/guide). To learn more about sass modules\nspecifically (introduced in v11), we recommend reading the docs for\n[`@use`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use).\n\n### How do I know what sass modules to include at the top of my files?\n\nSome of our most used sass assets are included below, along with what you would\nneed to have at the top of your file to use it. The `@use` example is\nspecifically if you are using our `@carbon/react` package. If you are using our\n`@carbon/styles` the path would be the same, simply replace `react` with\n`styles`. Essentially, all we are doing is including the path where we would\n[find these styles](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/main/packages/react/scss)\nin our package.\n\n| Carbon sass I'm using           | Sass modules to include                             |\n| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |\n| Theme tokens                    | `@use '@carbon/react/scss/theme'`                   |\n| Theme mixins                    | `@use '@carbon/react/scss/themes'`                  |\n| Design language color tokens    | `@use '@carbon/react/scss/colors'`                  |\n| Spacing tokens                  | `@use '@carbon/react/scss/spacing'`                 |\n| Breakpoint mixins               | `@use '@carbon/react/scss/breakpoint'`              |\n| Motion tokens and functions     | `@use '@carbon/react/scss/motion'`                  |\n| Rem and other convert functions | `@use '@carbon/react/scss/utilities/convert'`       |\n| Z-index helper                  | `@use '@carbon/react/scss/utilities/z-index'`       |\n| Focus outline helper            | `@use '@carbon/react/scss/utilities/focus-outline'` |\n| Transform rotate helper         | `@use '@carbon/react/scss/utilities/rotate'`        |\n| Skeleton animation helper       | `@use '@carbon/react/scss/utilities/skeleton'`      |\n\n### What is the \"as \\*\" used at the end of some `@use` statements?\n\nThis relates to the\n[default namespace that sass provides](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use#choosing-a-namespace)\nto all modules. You can change this namespace, but it's oftentimes more helpful\nto completely omit the namespace. `as *` accomplishes this.\n\nFor example, if you were using a color token like `$layer`, your scss file could\nlook something like this:\n\n```scss\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/theme' as *;\n\n.some-class {\n  background: $layer;\n}\n```\n\nIf you don't include `as *`, then it would look like this:\n\n```scss\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/theme';\n\n.some-class {\n  background: theme.$layer;\n}\n```\n\nWhere the token is prefixed by the name of the sass file (in this case `theme`).\n\n### What do I do with my old Feature flags?\n\nIf you were providing any configuration options before you imported Carbon you\ncan now provide them using the `with` syntax:\n\n```scss\n@use '@carbon/react' with (\n  $css--default-type: true,\n  $css--reset: true\n);\n```\n\nIf you were using any feature flags in v10, you can safely remove them in v11.\n\n**Note:** you can also use `@import` to bring in Carbon, if you prefer, although\n`@use` is recommended.\n\n## Additional resources\n\n<Row className=\"resource-card-group\">\n  <Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      subTitle=\"Custom theme example\"\n      href=\"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/main/examples/custom-theme\"\n    >\n      <MdxIcon name=\"github\" />\n    </ResourceCard>\n  </Column>\n  <Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      subTitle=\"V10 token compatibility in V11 example\"\n      href=\"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/main/examples/v10-token-compat-in-v11\"\n    >\n      <MdxIcon name=\"github\" />\n    </ResourceCard>\n  </Column>\n  <Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      subTitle=\"Light and dark mode example\"\n      href=\"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/main/examples/light-dark-mode\"\n    >\n      <MdxIcon name=\"github\" />\n    </ResourceCard>\n  </Column>\n  <Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      subTitle=\"Zoned theming example\"\n      href=\"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial/blob/v11-react-step-5/src/App.js\"\n    >\n      <MdxIcon name=\"github\" />\n    </ResourceCard>\n  </Column>\n  <Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      subTitle=\"Sass basics\"\n      href=\"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/docs/migration/v11.md#design-tokens\"\n    >\n      <MdxIcon name=\"github\" />\n    </ResourceCard>\n  </Column>\n  <Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      subTitle=\"v10 packages deprecation strategy\"\n      href=\"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/discussions/12179\"\n    >\n      <MdxIcon name=\"github\" />\n    </ResourceCard>\n  </Column>\n</Row>\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"aba76f25fe3082127b9942b2ee2d6f38","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":4891},"frontmatter":{"title":"FAQs","description":"This is a list of frequently asked questions when migrating from v10 to v11 of Carbon."},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: FAQs\ndescription:\n  This is a list of frequently asked questions when migrating from v10 to v11 of\n  Carbon.\n---\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n\n<AnchorLink>General</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Sass and package management</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Additional resources</AnchorLink>\n\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## General\n\n### What are the benefits of Carbon v11 for me as a designer?\n\n- Token names have been updated for easier application.

You can change this namespace, but it's oftentimes more helpful\nto completely omit the namespace. `as *` accomplishes this.\n\nFor example, if you were using a color token like `$layer`, your scss file could\nlook something like this:\n\n```scss\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/theme' as *;\n\n.some-class {\n  background: $layer;\n}\n```\n\nIf you don't include `as *`, then it would look like this:\n\n```scss\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/theme';\n\n.some-class {\n  background: theme.$layer;\n}\n```\n\nWhere the token is prefixed by the name of the sass file (in this case `theme`).\n\n### What do I do with my old Feature flags?\n\nIf you were providing any configuration options before you imported Carbon you\ncan now provide them using the `with` syntax:\n\n```scss\n@use '@carbon/react' with (\n  $css--default-type: true,\n  $css--reset: true\n);\n```\n\nIf you were using any feature flags in v10, you can safely remove them in v11.\n\n**Note:** you can also use `@import` to bring in Carbon, if you prefer, although\n`@use` is recommended.\n\n## Additional resources\n\n<Row className=\"resource-card-group\">\n  <Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      subTitle=\"Custom theme example\"\n      href=\"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/main/examples/custom-theme\"\n    >\n      <MdxIcon name=\"github\" />\n    </ResourceCard>\n  </Column>\n  <Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      subTitle=\"V10 token compatibility in V11 example\"\n      href=\"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/main/examples/v10-token-compat-in-v11\"\n    >\n      <MdxIcon name=\"github\" />\n    </ResourceCard>\n  </Column>\n  <Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      subTitle=\"Light and dark mode example\"\n      href=\"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/main/examples/light-dark-mode\"\n    >\n      <MdxIcon name=\"github\" />\n    </ResourceCard>\n  </Column>\n  <Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      subTitle=\"Zoned theming example\"\n      href=\"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial/blob/v11-react-step-5/src/App.js\"\n    >\n      <MdxIcon name=\"github\" />\n    </ResourceCard>\n  </Column>\n  <Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      subTitle=\"Sass basics\"\n      href=\"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/docs/migration/v11.md#design-tokens\"\n    >\n      <MdxIcon name=\"github\" />\n    </ResourceCard>\n  </Column>\n  <Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      subTitle=\"v10 packages deprecation strategy\"\n      href=\"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/discussions/12179\"\n    >\n      <MdxIcon name=\"github\" />\n    </ResourceCard>\n  </Column>\n</Row>\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/carbon-website/carbon-website/src/pages/migrating/faq.mdx"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1364590287","137577622","2102389209","2456312558","2746626797","3018647132","3037994772","768070550"]}
