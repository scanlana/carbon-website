All items can be reached by `Tab`. Toggling a\ncollapsed section with `Space` or `Enter` expands it, which reveals additional\nlinks. Activating any of the links (with `Enter`) updates the main content area\nand puts focus back at the top of the page. The link becomes bold to show it is\nthe current page.
