These lists have one header column of information with\nmultiple list item rows. Contained lists help you organize related content\nwithin smaller spaces within a user interface and allow you to include inline\nactions and interactive elements.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Contained list variants](images/contained-list-usage-1.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### When to use\n\n- Use on a page inside of small spaces or in disclosure situations.\n- Use when including interactive elements or inline actions in a list.\n- To logically group items that follow the same content structure.\n\n### When not to use\n\n- Do not use if the list content needs to be nested more than one level deep and\n  becomes overly complex and lengthy. For these situations, use the\n  [data table](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/data-table/usage/)\n  component instead.\n- Do not use if the list needs to contain multiple column headers, instead use\n  the\n  [structured list](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/structured-list/usage/)\n  component.\n\n### Variants\n\n| Variant                           | Purpose                                                                                                                                                |\n| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| [On-page list](#on-page-list)     | Use this variant when placing the list in a persistent context like the main area in the user interface, such as on a card or in a sidebar.            |\n| [Disclosed list](#disclosed-list) | Use this variant when the list is shown within a temporary context, for example within a popover or layer that is elevated by a drop shadow or border. |\n\n## Live demo\n\n<StorybookDemo\n  themeSelector\n  url=\"https://react.carbondesignsystem.com\"\n  variants={[\n    {\n      label: 'Default',\n      variant: 'components-containedlist--default',\n    },\n    {\n      label: 'Disclosed',\n      variant: 'components-containedlist--disclosed',\n    },\n    {\n      label: 'With Actions',\n      variant: 'components-containedlist--with-actions',\n    },\n    {\n      label: 'With Icons',\n      variant: 'components-containedlist--with-icons',\n    },\n    {\n      label: 'With Interactive Items',\n      variant: 'components-containedlist--with-interactive-items',\n    },\n    {\n      label: 'With Interactive Items and Actions',\n      variant: 'components-containedlist--with-interactive-items-and-actions',\n    },\n    {\n      label: 'With List Title Decorators',\n      variant: 'components-containedlist--with-list-title-decorators',\n    },\n  ]}\n/>\n\n## Formatting\n\n### Anatomy\n\nContained lists are made up of a list header area, list title, list item rows,\nand optional interactive elements.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Contained list anatomy](images/contained-list-usage-2.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n1. **List header area:** Area to group the succeeding list items.\n2. **List title:** Descriptive name for the group of list items.\n3. **List item:** The content with in a list item row.\n4. **Interactive element** (optional): An interactive element in the header or\n   row such as a button, link, icon, or toggle.\n\n### Alignment\n\nContained lists can have multiple sections and stack on top of each other. When\nstacking multiple on-page lists, there should be 16px padding ($spacing-05)\nbetween each list. When stacking multiple disclosed lists, stack them to be\nflush with 0px padding between each other.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Contained list alignment](images/contained-list-usage-3.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Scrolling\n\nContained list header areas can be sticky and fixed in place while the list item\nrows scroll underneath. This functionality is optional depending on the use\ncase.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Contained list scrolling](images/contained-list-usage-4.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Content\n\n### Main elements\n\n#### List title\n\n- A list title is a descriptive name for the group of list items.\n- List titles should be short and clear, ranging from one to three words to\n  describe the list group.\n- Use sentence case capitalization.\n\n#### List item\n\n- List item text can vary but the structure of the content should be similar per\n  row in the same contained list.\n- List item text can have multiple lines of concise content, but should not\n  contain multiple paragraphs of lengthy information.\n- Use sentence case capitalization.\n\n## On-page list\n\nUse the on-page list variant when placing the list on the general page of a user\ninterface. On-page lists typically appear in smaller spaces, like in a card or\nsidebars. The on-page list styling has no visible background header with fixed\ninformation. If there are scrolling capabilities, the header will remain sticky\nand have a background layer to differentiate it from the list item rows\nscrolling beneath it.\n\n### Placement\n\nOn-page lists should span the entire width of the container they are placed\nwithin to make the best use of space and to achieve vertical type alignment with\nother text and components on the page.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Contained list on-page variant in context image](images/contained-list-usage-5.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Sizing\n\nThe on-page list comes in four height sizes — extra large (64px), large (48px),\nmedium (40px), and small (32px). The large height size is the default size.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Height sizes for on-page variant](images/contained-list-usage-6.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\nThe list header height is always fixed, while list item row heights can vary\nbased on the amount of content in each row. The content in each row is flexible,\nbut by default each list item row height follows the extra large, large, or\nsmall height size for one line of content.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Row content size for on-page variant](images/contained-list-usage-7.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Disclosed list\n\nUse the disclosed list variant when placing the list within a temporary context,\nlike a popover or disclosure, which is typically accompanied by an enclosed\nborder or drop shadow. The disclosed list styling has a background layer\nunderneath the header. Each header has a smaller height than the on-page list\nstyling to take up less real estate in the smaller and scrollable spaces it\nusually appears in.\n\n### Placement\n\nDisclosed lists should span the entire width of the container they are placed\nwithin to make the best use of space.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Contained list disclosed variant in context image](images/contained-list-usage-8.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Sizing\n\nThe disclosed list header has a 32px height and the list item rows by default\nhave a 48px height. The disclosed list often appears in small, restricted places\nso keeping a shorter height can save valuable space and reduce the amount of\nvertical scrolling.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Height sizes for disclosed variant](images/contained-list-usage-9.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\nSimilarly to the on-page list variant, the list header height is always fixed,\nwhile list item row heights can vary based on the amount of content in each row.\nThe content in each row is flexible, but by default each list item row height\nfollows a 48px height for one line of content.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Row content size for disclosed variant](images/contained-list-usage-10.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Modifiers\n\n### Inset row dividers\n\nDepending on the use case you can inset contained list row dividers. By default,\nuse extended row dividers for row items. Typically indented row dividers are\nused when placed close to other components that also contain row dividers so\nthey do not collide with each other and create visual tension.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Contained list row dividers](images/contained-list-usage-11.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Clickable rows\n\nContained lists support clickable rows as an optional feature.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Contained list clickable rows](images/contained-list-usage-12.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Inline actions\n\nContained lists can include inline actions, such as closing or dismissing row\nitems in the list.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Contained list inline actions](images/contained-list-usage-13.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Interactive elements\n\nContained lists can have interactive elements in headers and rows, such as\nlinks, icon buttons, and toggles. Contained lists can also have multiple row\ncolumns. Additional row columns act as list item details pertaining to the first\nlist item in the row. If your list has an excess of row columns and needs\nmultiple column headers, we recommend using a data table instead.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Contained list interactive elements](images/contained-list-usage-14.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Search and filtering\n\nContained lists can include a search or filter functionality. The search or\nfilter can collapse and expand in the list header area or stay persistent on the\npage below the list header area, depending on the use case.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Contained list search and filtering functionality](images/contained-list-usage-15.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Related\n\n- [Accordion](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/accordion/usage/)\n- [Data table](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/data-table/usage/)\n- [List](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/list/usage/)\n- [Structured list](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/structured-list/usage/)\n\n## Feedback\n\nHelp us improve this component by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"5ee8c2bf9a47b98568b26502fb21fee9","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":4252},"frontmatter":{"title":"Contained list","description":"Contained lists group content that is similar or related and can contain read-only or interactive information.","tabs":["Usage","Style","Code","Accessibility"]},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Contained list\ndescription:\n  Contained lists group content that is similar or related and can contain\n  read-only or interactive information.\ntabs: ['Usage', 'Style', 'Code', 'Accessibility']\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nContained lists group content that is similar or related and can contain\nread-only or interactive information.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n\n<AnchorLink>Overview</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Live demo</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Formatting</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Content</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>On-page list</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Disclosed list</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Modifiers</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Related</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Feedback</AnchorLink>\n\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Overview\n\nContained lists are commonly used inside of containers like cards, sidebars, and\ndisclosure situations.
