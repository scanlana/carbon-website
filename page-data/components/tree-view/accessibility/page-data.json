When trees have focus, arrow keys\nprovide navigation. The `Right arrow` key expands a closed branch node. If a\nbranch is open, the `Right arrow` moves into the first child node. Pressing the\n`Left arrow` key on an open branch collapses it. Left arrowing on a child moves\nthe focus to the parent branch. `Up` and `Down arrow` keys move vertically\nthrough open branches and their child nodes. A node or branch is selected by\n`Space` or `Enter` keys.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![tabbing into a tree, focus lands on the current item, and tabbing again leaves the tree](images/tree-view-accessibility-1.png)\n\n<Caption>The tree view takes a single tab stop.</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![illustration showing keyboard interaction](images/tree-view-accessibility-2.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  Arrow keys operate and move around in the nodes of a tree.
