Carbon incorporates many\nother accessibility considerations, some of which are described below.\n\n### Keyboard interactions (default slider)\n\nTab order goes from slider to number input. Arrow keys are used to change the\nslider value. `Shift` + `Arrow` changes the slider value by a larger increment\n(such as by 10 instead of 1).

A value of `\"1\"` is recommended.\n- The `stepMultiplier` determines the value change when the keyboard is used to\n  alter the slider by pressing `Shift`+ Arrow key. A tenth of the total range is\n  recommended as a value, such as `\"10\"` in a 0-100 slider.\n- See the\n  [ARIA authoring practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/#slider)\n  for more considerations.\n\n### Error handling\n\nIf an inputted value is outside the allowed range, the slider will auto-correct\nto the nearest allowed digit. When the inputted value results in an error, the\nerror will display alongside the corresponding text input.\n\nIn the range slider, if the inputted value is not logically correct (for\nexample, if a minimum value is greater than the maximum value), a warning\nmessage will be generated that informs the user that a value was autocorrected\nto the nearest allowed digit.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"f3576ef12f1c540aacc47a2765b8134f","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":4841},"frontmatter":{"title":"Slider","description":"No accessibility annotations are needed for sliders, but keep these considerations in mind if you are modifying Carbon or creating a custom component.","tabs":["Usage","Style","Code","Accessibility"]},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Slider\ndescription:\n  No accessibility annotations are needed for sliders, but keep these\n  considerations in mind if you are modifying Carbon or creating a custom\n  component.\ntabs: ['Usage', 'Style', 'Code', 'Accessibility']\n---\n\nimport localVideoOne from './videos/default-slider-demo.mp4';\nimport localPosterOne from './images/slider-accessibility-default-mp4-image.png';\nimport localVideoTwo from './videos/range-slider-demo.mp4';\nimport localPosterTwo from './images/slider-accessibility-range-mp4-image.png';\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nNo accessibility annotations are needed for sliders, but keep these\nconsiderations in mind if you are modifying Carbon or creating a custom\ncomponent.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink>What Carbon provides</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Development considerations</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## What Carbon provides\n\nCarbon bakes keyboard operation into its components, improving the experience of\nblind users and others who operate via the keyboard.
